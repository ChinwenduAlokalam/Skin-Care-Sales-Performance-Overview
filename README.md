## Skin Care Products Sales & Profitability Analysis (2022)

### Overview  
This project explores the **sales and profitability performance of skincare products** across different product categories, cities, customer segments, and regions in the year 2022.

Using a combination of **SQL queries** and a **Power BI dashboard**, I aimed to uncover valuable insights about the business’s most profitable areas, sales patterns, and customer behaviors.

I created a date table in PostgreSQL and Power BI which was used for the time based trend analysis.

### Project Objectives  

The primary questions this project sought to answer were:

- What is the **most profitable product category**?  
- Which **city generated the most profit**?  
- Which **customer segment was the most profitable**?  
- Which **month generated the most profit**?

### Key Findings  

- A total of **75,000 products** were sold across **7,000 orders** during the year **2022**.  
- The **Corporate segment** generated the highest profit, contributing approximately **52% of total profit**.  
- The **Europe market** contributed the most to total profit with about **$91,405**.  
- The month of **August** recorded the highest **revenue** at approximately **$202,000**, while **June** achieved the highest **profit** of about **$42,000**.  
- The **United States (North America)** generated both the highest overall **profit and revenue**.  
- While **Los Angeles** led in **total revenue**, **New York City** contributed the most to total **profit**.  
- On average, **Thursdays** recorded the **lowest sales volume** compared to other weekdays.  
- Though **Central America** contributed most to total **revenue**, **Western Europe** recorded the highest **profit contribution**.  
-  **Face care products** sold the highest number of units over time, but it was **Body care products** that generated the most **profit and revenue** over the entire year.  

> **Insight:** This highlights a valuable business lesson — a product’s high sales volume doesn’t always translate to higher profit contribution.

### Limitations  

- The dataset covers only the year **2022**, limiting time-based trend analysis to just **days of the week, months, and quarters**.
- Absence of **cost-related variables per product unit** limited deeper margin analysis beyond available profit data.
