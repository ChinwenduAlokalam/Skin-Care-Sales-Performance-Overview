# 📊 Skin Care Products Sales & Profitability Analysis (2022)

## 📑 Overview  
This project explores the **sales and profitability performance of skincare products** across different product categories, cities, customer segments, and regions in the year 2022.

Using a combination of **SQL queries** and a **Power BI dashboard**, I aimed to uncover valuable insights about the business’s most profitable areas, sales patterns, and customer behaviors.

I created a date table in PostgreSQL and Power BI which was used for the time based trend analysis.

- 🌍 The **Europe market** contributed the most to total profit with about **$91,405**.  
- 📅 The month of **August** recorded the highest **revenue** at approximately **$202,000**, while **June** achieved the highest **profit** of about **$42,000**.  
- 🇺🇸 The **United States (North America)** generated both the highest overall **profit and revenue**.
